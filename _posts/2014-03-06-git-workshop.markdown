_Git_ is a distributed version control system.
It is one skill every software professional is
bound to find necessary in their career. We use it here
to run our website and do other cool stuff. You
will learn how to manage your projects better with
Git and be introduced to the popular code sharing
website github.com. Participants also get a tiny
surprise gift. [The slides are now available.](https://speakerdeck.com/sri/git-set-go)
