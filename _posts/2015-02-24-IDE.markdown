Integrated Development Environments (IDE) are software applications that 
provide a complete set of tools for computer programmers for software 
development. Most IDE normally consist of a source code editor, build 
automation tools, and a debugger, but is not limited to those options. 
In this workshop, you will be introduced to common IDE such as Eclipse, 
Visual Studio, and Android Studio. You will learn why an IDE is used and 
some advantages of using an IDE such as code completion, debugger, 
code correction, and much more. This is a great opportunity to come 
learn from a current software developer about a tool that every software 
developer will use at some point in their career.
