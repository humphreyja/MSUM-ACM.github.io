Virtualization makes it possible to run Ubuntu Linux or Mac OS X on a regular
Windows PC within a window like another Windows program. In this workshop, you
will learn how to do that more. You will be given tips and be helped with
setting up and using Virtual Box — a free software package that is
indispensable to students of Computer Science and related fields.  This is a
great event to meet/socialize with fellow ACM members and other students from
our department.
