Interested at proving your programming skills to others including potential employers? Programming Competitions are the perfect way to do that! In this informational workshop we will be covering the basics of what programming competitions are and what you should expect if you are attending one. Oh, and did I mention that you could score a job at Google for competing? That's right! Google hosts one of the top programming competitions in the world, Code Jam. Interested but not sure if you got what it takes? Come anyways and show your interest! We're even talking about setting up local practise competitions to help you out when it comes time to compete in larger competitions like Code Jam.
