The _Raspberry Pi_ is a capable little credit-card
sized computer that plugs into your TV and
keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects,
setting up webservers and even for regular desktop
computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing
or games. It can play high-definition video too.
Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis for a 
variety of interesting projects. In this hang out we 
invite you to bring your own _Raspberry Pi_, _Arduino_, or
_Beagle Bone_ and show off some of the cool projects you 
have done with it!
