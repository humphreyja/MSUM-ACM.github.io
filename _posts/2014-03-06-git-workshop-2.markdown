What is Source Control and why would you every
use it? Come take this opportunity to learn
the concepts of source control, how to use it,
and learn of the benefits of using it. We will
be working primarily with Git, an open-source
distributed version control system that is used
widely by software professionals in their career.
Git also serves as the platform of the popular
service github.com that allows you to share
your programs all around the world. We even use
github.com to host our website!
