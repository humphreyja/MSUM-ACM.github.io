The _Raspberry Pi_ is a capable little credit-card
sized computer that plugs into your TV and
keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects,
setting up webservers and even for regular desktop
computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing
or games. It can play high-definition video too.
Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis for a
variety of interesting projects. In this workshop
you will be introduced to the Raspberry Pi, learn
about it’s many features and get pointers on how
to start your own Pi projects.
