The _Raspberry Pi_ is a capable little credit-card
sized computer that plugs into your TV and
a keyboard. It can be used for electronics
projects, setting up webservers and even for
regular desktop computer tasks like spreadsheets,
word-processing or games. It can even play
high-definition video. Many MSUM students have
Raspberry Pi’s and use them for a variety of
projects. In this workshop you will be introduced
to a Raspberry Pi, learn about it's many features
& capabilities and get pointers on starting
your own project with one.
