The _Raspberry Pi_ is a capable little credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects, setting up webservers and even for regular desktop computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing or games. It can play high-definition video too. Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis and use them for a variety of interesting projects. In this workshop you will be introduced to a Raspberry Pi, learn about it’s many features & capabilities and get pointers on how to start your own project with one.
