        <p>Virtualization makes it possible to run Ubuntu Linux or Mac OS X on a regular
Windows PC within a window like another Windows program. In this workshop, you
will learn how to do that more. You will be given tips and be helped with
setting up and using Virtual Box — a free software package that is
indispensable to students of Computer Science and related fields.  This is a
great event to meet/socialize with fellow ACM members and other students from
our department. Yes, there will be pizza.</p>

      <div class="event-page-description">
        <p>As computer scientists and technologists, we can do better than just making
code that works – we can make code that matters.  Diving through science
fiction, ubiquitous computing and a history of cloud technologies as we know
them, Alex will take the audience on a journey to discover the very heart of
why we code.  Alex Brandt is a Cloud Evangelist at Rackspace. Today he speaks
on behalf of Rackspace on a variety of topics. Previously his work focused on
training employees in Cloud, Python, Ruby, and Chef. He regularly consults with
Rackspace customers to develop unique solutions while internally developing new
approaches with evolving technologies. Alex holds a degree in Computer Science
and Physics from Minnesota State University, Moorhead</p>

be having one of our seniors present his senior
seminar project that he built using an Arduino
board! If you have an Arduino board we would love
to have to attend and present what you use your
Arduino for! This will be a great event to meet
and socialize with a variety of students in our
department and our MSUM ACM Chapter. All students
are welcome!</p>

        <p>The <em>Raspberry Pi</em> is a capable little credit-card
sized computer that plugs into your TV and
keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects,
setting up webservers and even for regular desktop
computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing
or games. It can play high-definition video too.
Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis for a
variety of interesting projects. In this workshop
you will be introduced to the Raspberry Pi, learn
about it’s many features and get pointers on how
to start your own Pi projects.</p>
