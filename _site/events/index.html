        <p>Interested at proving your programming skills to others including potential employers? Programming Competitions are the perfect way to do that! In this informational workshop we will be covering the basics of what programming competitions are and what you should expect if you are attending one. Oh, and did I mention that you could score a job at Google for competing? That&rsquo;s right! Google hosts one of the top programming competitions in the world, Code Jam. Interested but not sure if you got what it takes? Come anyways and show your interest! We&rsquo;re even talking about setting up local practise competitions to help you out when it comes time to compete in larger competitions like Code Jam.</p>

        <p>What is Source Control and why would you every
use it? Come take this opportunity to learn
the concepts of source control, how to use it,
and learn of the benefits of using it. We will
be working primarily with Git, an open-source
distributed version control system that is used
widely by software professionals in their career.
Git also serves as the platform of the popular
service github.com that allows you to share
your programs all around the world. We even use
github.com to host our website!</p>

        <p>As computer scientists and technologists, we can do better than just making
code that works – we can make code that matters.  Diving through science
fiction, ubiquitous computing and a history of cloud technologies as we know
them, Alex will take the audience on a journey to discover the very heart of
why we code.  Alex Brandt is a Cloud Evangelist at Rackspace. Today he speaks
on behalf of Rackspace on a variety of topics. Previously his work focused on
training employees in Cloud, Python, Ruby, and Chef. He regularly consults with
Rackspace customers to develop unique solutions while internally developing new

sized computer that plugs into your TV and
keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects,
setting up webservers and even for regular desktop
computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing
or games. It can play high-definition video too.
Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis for a
variety of interesting projects. In this workshop
you will be introduced to the Raspberry Pi, learn
about it’s many features and get pointers on how
